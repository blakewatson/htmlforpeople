# Adding a blog

Blogs are a huge part of the web. You’ve likely heard of several popular blogging platforms like WordPress, Tumblr, and Blogger. And there are tons of [smaller indie blogging platforms](https://perma.cc/K3PV-JL9S).

But you don’t _need_ one of these platforms to have a blog. A blog is just a series of posts in chronological order (typically _reverse_ chronological with the newest posts first). We can totally do that with HTML!

I’ll add three blog posts. I won't put all the code here in this chapter since that would be a bit wordy. You can check out the demo site to see the completed articles. But I _will_ show you how to structure the files and review some of the different HTML tags we can use.

## Create the blog home

Follow these steps to make the blog available at `sitename.neocities.org/blog`.

1. Create a folder called `blog`; inside it, create a file called `index.html`.
2. Copy the contents of one of your other pages and paste it into this new, empty `index.html` file.
3. Change the `<h1>` to "Blog," "My Blog," or whatever you’d like to name it.
4. Change the `<title>` to change what appears on the tab. For instance, "Blog - Blake’s Homepage."
5. Clear out the main content so you have an empty `<main>` tag. We'll add content later.

Let’s open it in the browser and see how it looks.

![Screenshot of the "Blog" page on Blake's website. The page has minimal styling due to broken file references. It features a simple, unstyled layout with plain black text on a white background. The header contains links to "Home" and "About" in blue, underlined text, indicating default browser styling. The main title "Blog" is bold and large, but the overall appearance lacks the structured design seen on previous pages.](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-1.webp)

Whoa, we broke it; what happened!? It has to do with the file structure. Look at our `<link>` tag, where we added our Simple.css styles.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/simple.css">
```

It’s looking for `css/simple.css` but can’t find it. Why? The path we gave it is _relative_ to the current file. The current file is in the `blog` folder, so it looks for `blog/css/simple.css`, which doesn’t exist.

So, how do we refer to files that aren’t in the current folder? We can use the `..` syntax like this.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/simple.css">
```

That means "move up one level, then look for css/simple.css."

![Screenshot of the "Blog" page on Blake's website with corrected styling. The page now displays a light-colored header with rounded buttons for "Home" and "About," enhancing navigation. The main title "Blog" is prominently centered and bold, with a clear visual hierarchy. The footer is styled with a thin dividing line above it, containing the centered text.](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-2.webp)

That’s better! Now, let’s update the navigation. Since the home page and the About page aren’t in the current folder, we’ll need to use the same `..` syntax to link to them.

```html
<nav>
  <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
  <a href="index.html" aria-current="page">Blog</a>
  <a href="../about.html">About</a>
</nav>
```

You’ll also need to update the navigation on the other pages to include a link to the blog. For example, the homepage nav should look like this.

```html
<nav>
  <a href="index.html" aria-current="page">Home</a>
  <a href="blog/index.html">Blog</a>
  <a href="about.html">About</a>
</nav>
```

{% aside 'Note' %}
Since we're opening our website files directly in the browser, we're using _relative URLs_ to form links to other pages and files. In an upcoming chapter, we'll learn how to [run a local web server](/intermission-installing-a-local-web-server) and how doing so will enable us to use _absolute URLs_, which are more straightforward.
{% endaside %}

## Create the first post

I’m going to write a silly post about teaching a cat HTML. I'll create a `2024-04-12-whiskers.html` file in the `blog` folder. You can name your blog post file whatever you want. The nice thing about including the date is that, as you create more posts, they'll appear in order on your computer’s filesystem.

As a starting point, we'll copy the contents of `blog/index.html` into our new file. I'll change the `<h1>` (and the `<title>`) to be the name of my article, "How I taught my cat to make a website with HTML." I will also modify the navigation. We aren't on the Blog listing page, so it's inaccurate to say `aria-current="page"` on the blog nav link. But it _is_ within the Blog section of the site. So I will change the attribute to the more general `aria-current="true"`. This is **only for individual blog post pages**.

```html
<nav>
  <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
  <a href="index.html" aria-current="true">Blog</a>
  <a href="../about.html">About</a>
</nav>
```

I'll add a link back to the blog at the end of the post. Since we're already in the `blog` folder, linking to `index.html` is all we need to reach the blog home.

```html
<a href="index.html" class="button">&larr; Back to the blog</a>
```

The `class="button"` bit is a style that Simple.css provides that makes a text link look like a button. The `&larr;` is a special code called an _HTML entity_. They are used for encoding special characters. This particular one is a _left arrow_. You can see a [list of other entities here](https://perma.cc/BEA6-LF46).

I'll add three blog posts dated a few days apart, just for example purposes. When I’m done, I'll have these posts.

- [How I taught my cat to make a website with HTML](https://demo.htmlforpeople.com/blog/2024-04-12-whiskers.html)
- [The time I built a website for aliens](https://demo.htmlforpeople.com/blog/2024-04-15-aliens.html)
- [Why donuts are the best thing ever](https://demo.htmlforpeople.com/blog/2024-04-20-donuts)

My file structure will look like this:

- `blog`
  - `2024-04-12-whiskers.html`
  - `2024-04-15-aliens.html`
  - `2024-04-20-donuts.html`
  - `index.html`
- `css`
  - `simple.css`
- `images`
  - `blake.jpg`
  - `space.jpg`
- `about.html`
- `index.html`

## Text formatting

Let’s see some tags you can use in your blog posts and other pages.

For bold and italics, we can use the tags `<strong>` and `<em>`, respectively.

```html
<p>
  After just three days, <strong>Whiskers can now create web pages</strong> better than <em>I</em> can!
</p>
```

Which would render like this.

![Screenshot of the rendered text shows the following in bold: "Whiskers can now create web pages"](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-3.webp)

## Block quotes

We can use the `<blockquote>` tag to quote a person, a book, another website, or even ourselves.

```html
<blockquote>
  "HTML is <strong>elementary</strong> my dear Watson."<br>
  <cite>&mdash; Whiskers, probably</cite>
</blockquote>
```

Here, I’m using `<strong>` to give extra emphasis. I'm using the `<cite>` tag to display the source of the quote. The _self-closing_ `<br>` tag creates a manual line break, which pushes the `<cite>` element to the following line. I used another special character, `&mdash;`, to create an [_em dash_](https://practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html).

![A stylized blockquote rendered in a web browser. The quote "HTML is elementary my dear Watson." is italicized with the word "elementary" also in bold. A blue vertical bar appears on the left side of the quote, adding a visual emphasis. Below the quote, the citation "— Whiskers, probably" is displayed in a smaller font, aligned to the left, creating a visually distinct attribution.](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-4.webp)

Block quotes are typically styled as indented blocks of text, often with a border or background color for extra emphasis. The above image shows how Simple.css styles them (unless noted otherwise, all of the example images I post are HTML styled with Simple.css).

## Recap: headings and lists

We covered these briefly in Chapter 2, [Add content to your website](/add-content-to-your-website), but it’s worth recapping. Our blog posts already use the topmost heading, the `<h1>`, but if you’re writing a blog post that needs more headings, that’s totally fine!

Headings in HTML are hierarchical, meaning `<h2>` headings should follow `<h1>` headings, `<h3>` headings should follow `<h2>` headings, and so on. Technically, HTML gives us six heading levels—`<h1>` through `<h6>`. But moderation is key here. Ask yourself if you’re _really_ making your page easier to understand by adding so many levels of headings. My advice is to stick with three levels or less.

And, of course, we have lists. We covered these in Chapter 2, but let's look at them again. You’ve got two options here—a bulleted list (called _unordered_) and a numbered list (called _ordered_).

Here’s a bulleted or _unordered_ list using the `<ul>` tag for the list and `<li>` for each _list item_.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Bread</li>
  <li>Sugar</li>
  <li>Hole</li>
</ul>
```

Which renders like this.

- Bread
- Sugar
- Hole

And here’s a numbered or _ordered_ list (with some bolded points for emphasis).

```html
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Portable Happiness:</strong> Donuts are the perfect grab-and-go
    food. You can take them anywhere: to work, to the park, or on a road trip.
    They're like little circles of happiness that fit in your hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Instant Mood Boost:</strong> Feeling down? Have a donut. It's
    scientifically proven* that donuts can turn a frown upside down. (*Not
    actually proven, but we all know it's true.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Endless Creativity:</strong> Donut shops are constantly coming up
    with new and exciting flavors. From maple bacon to matcha green tea, the
    possibilities are endless. It's like a delicious adventure every time you
    visit.
  </li>
</ol>
```

Here’s how that looks.

1. **Portable Happiness:** Donuts are the perfect grab-and-go food. You can take them anywhere: to work, to the park, or on a road trip. They're like little circles of happiness that fit in your hand.
2. **Instant Mood Boost:** Feeling down? Have a donut. It's scientifically proven* that donuts can turn a frown upside down. (*Not actually proven, but we all know it's true.)
3. **Endless Creativity:** Donut shops are constantly coming up with new and exciting flavors. From maple bacon to matcha green tea, the possibilities are endless. It's like a delicious adventure every time you visit.

You can even _nest_ lists like this.

```html
<ul>
  <li>
    First main point
    <ul>
      <li>Sub point</li>
      <li>Another sub point</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Second main point
    <ul>
      <li>Sub-point</li>
      <li>Another sub-point</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

That would render something like this.

- First main point
  - Sub point
  - Another sub-point
- Second main point
  - Sub point
  - Another sub-point

## Breaking up content

One of the ways we can manually add space between elements is the `<br>` tag or _break_ tag. The break tag adds a line break. For example, consider this haiku (by [Robert Cole](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/02/180532424/send-your-haiku-to-mars-nasa-seeks-poets#comment-882372940)).

```html
<p>
  A timeless red orb
  floats lazy in the ether
  unimpressed by war.
</p>
```

By default, the browser will render everything on one line and ignore most whitespace in your HTML.

![A single line of text rendered in a web browser: "A timeless red orb floats lazy in the ether unimpressed by war." The text is displayed in a standard sans-serif font with no additional styling, centered horizontally on the page.](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-5.webp)

On the one hand, this is a good thing—it means we can format our code how we want without our visitors seeing a ton of line breaks and indentation on the page that we didn’t intend. But sometimes, we _do_ want actual line breaks.

We can fix our haiku by putting a couple of `<br>` tags in there.

```html
<p>
  A timeless red orb<br>
  floats lazy in the ether<br>
  unimpressed by war.
</p>
```

![Multi-line text in a web browser with natural word wrapping: "A timeless red orb floats lazy in the ether unimpressed by war." The text is displayed in a standard sans-serif font and is broken into three lines.](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-6.webp)

This is helpful in small doses but use it sparingly. Most of the time, spacing between elements should be controlled with CSS—by applying `margin` or `padding`, for example. Fortunately, our Simple.css stylesheet has good default spacing. We'll cover using CSS for customized spacing in the [bonus chapter](/css-basics) at the end of this book.

Another way to manually break up content is to use a _horizontal rule_, or `<hr>` tag. It’s typically styled as a horizontal line. This can be helpful when you want to separate content—like a new section or a new scene, in the case of a story. Here’s what it can look like.

![Two paragraphs of placeholder text rendered in a web browser. The paragraphs are separated by a horizontal line, providing a clear visual division. The text is displayed in a standard sans-serif font, with each paragraph having adequate line spacing, enhancing readability.](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-7.webp)

{% aside 'Note' %}
What’s up with the nonsensical text? It’s Latin-ish text called _[lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)_ that is often used in design situations where you want to see what text looks like without being distracted by what the text says.
{% endaside %}

## Code and pre-formatted text

I've been using these tags _a lot_ on the pages you've been reading in this book. Consider this paragraph:

```html
<p>
  By the end of day one, he was familiar with basic tags like <code>html</code>,
  <code>head</code>, and <code>body</code>. On day two, he was creating
  paragraphs and lists. By day three, he had moved on to creating stunning
  layouts with <code>article</code> and <code>section</code>.
</p>
```

That will display the code bits in a monospaced font and a different color, like this.

![A paragraph of text rendered in a web browser with specific HTML tags highlighted in red. The text reads: "By the end of day one, he was familiar with basic tags like html, head, and body." The highlighted words "html," "head," and "body" are in red with a monospaced font, while the rest of the text remains in black, drawing attention to these specific terms.](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-8.webp)

You've seen me include the less-than (`<`) and greater-than (`>`) symbols in my code elements on the pages of this book (like this, `<a>`). That takes a little bit of extra work. Like if I want to mention an `<a>` tag, I can’t simply write `<code><a></code>` because the browser will think I'm trying to make a literal link inside the `<code>` tag. To include the less-than and greater-than symbols (sometimes called "angle brackets"), we'll need the HTML entities `&lt;` and <span style="text-wrap: nowrap">`&gt;`, </span>respectively. That will tell the browser we want to render the actual symbols.

```html
<p>
  By the end of day one, he was familiar with basic tags like
  <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and
  <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. On day two, he was creating paragraphs and lists.
  By day three, he had moved on to creating stunning layouts with
  <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>.
</p>
```

That gives us the following.

![A paragraph similar to the previous one but with HTML tags surrounded by angle brackets, emphasizing their role as HTML elements. The text reads: "By the end of day one, he was familiar with basic tags like <html>, <head>, and <body>."](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-9.webp)

As we saw earlier, when rendering your content, the browser ignores most of the whitespace in your code. But sometimes, you want to preserve the exact spacing and line breaks. A fun example is ASCII art, which is when you make art with plain text characters.

<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html mono">    ___       ___       ___       ___   
   /\__\     /\  \     /\__\     /\__\  
  /:/__/_    \:\  \   /::L_L_   /:/  /  
 /::\/\__\   /::\__\ /:/L:\__\ /:/__/   
 \/\::/  /  /:/\/__/ \/_/:/  / \:\  \   
   /:/  /   \/__/      /:/  /   \:\__\  
   \/__/               \/__/     \/__/</code></pre>

The above should appear as the letters "HTML" using a 3d effect. It works because it uses a monospaced font and preserves all the whitespace. How did I do it? I used the `<pre>` tag, which is for _pre-formatted_ text. Use it like this.

<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html mono">&lt;pre&gt;
    ___       ___       ___       ___   
   /\__\     /\  \     /\__\     /\__\  
  /:/__/_    \:\  \   /::L_L_   /:/  /  
 /::\/\__\   /::\__\ /:/L:\__\ /:/__/   
 \/\::/  /  /:/\/__/ \/_/:/  / \:\  \   
   /:/  /   \/__/      /:/  /   \:\__\  
   \/__/               \/__/     \/__/
&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre>

If you’d like to play with more ASCII text art, check out this [text art generator](https://perma.cc/E5NZ-SV56).

## Asides

The `<aside>` tag is fun since Simple.css styles it in an interesting way. These are useful for callouts or _asides_ to the main content. For example, I included an aside that lists ingredients in my [blog post about donuts](https://demo.htmlforpeople.com/blog/2024-04-20-donuts).

![Screenshot of a blog post titled "Why donuts are the best thing ever," dated April 20, 2024. The page features a navigation menu with "Home," "Blog" (highlighted), and "About" buttons. The post discusses the joy and versatility of donuts, with a sidebar box listing "Donut ingredients" (Bread, Sugar, Hole). The layout is clean and well-spaced for readability.](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-10.webp)

Simple.css will style the aside as a rounded box and shift it to the side. This is a neat way to add extra notes or secondary content to a page.

## Mark, strikethrough, deletion, insertion

Here are some more text formatting tags for you. Use `<mark>` to <mark>highlight text</mark>. If you want strikethrough <s>unwanted</s> text, wrap it in the `<s>` tag. If you want to explicitly show edits to a document, prefer the `<del>` tag for indicating a deletion and the `<ins>` tag to show inserted text. For example, this is from my donut post.

![Screenshot of text with strikethrough and underline formatting. The phrase "it's vegetables" is struck through, and "donuts" is underlined, emphasizing the replacement of "vegetables" with "donuts" to highlight a humorous preference in the sentence.](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-11.webp)

## Fill out our blog index page

Okay, we've covered a variety of tags you can use to _mark up_ different types of content. You can take some time and play with these. There’s no rush! I'll be right here when you’re ready. Once you have two or three blog posts, let's put them on the main blog page.

If you open `blog/index.html`, it looks a bit empty. We'll fix that now by displaying the title of each blog post, the newest first, the publish date, and a one-sentence summary. Clicking the title of a blog post should take the reader to it.

Let’s use the `<article>` tag for each one because each represents an independent composition. As a bonus, Simple.css will style these as cards. Let’s use `<h2>` for the blog post title, inside of which we will put a link (the `<a>` tag). We'll use the `time` tag for the date. We'll use a regular paragraph, or `<p>` tag, for the summary. The final markup looks like this.

```html
<main>
  <article>
    <h2>
      <a href="2024-04-20-donuts.html">
        Why donuts are the best thing ever
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p><time datetime="2024-04-20">April 20, 2024</time></p>
    <p>
      Donuts are the ultimate comfort food because of their versatility,
      variety, portability, mood-boosting power, and endless creative flavors.
    </p>
  </article>
</main>
```

The link in the header will take an `href` _attribute_, the link's destination. Since we're already in the `blog` folder, we can use the blog post filename as the destination.

We're using the `<time>` tag to provide a machine-friendly version of the date. That could be useful for search engines searching your site or supporting potential browser features that rely on dates. The `<time>` tag takes an attribute called `datetime` where you can provide the [machine-readable version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time#valid_datetime_values).

Add an `<article>` like the above for each blog post you want to link to. You will end up with something like this.

![Screenshot of a blog listing page with a header containing navigation buttons for "Home," "Blog" (highlighted), and "About." The main heading reads "Blog." Below are three blog post previews with titles in blue: "Why donuts are the best thing ever," "The time I built a website for aliens," and "How I taught my cat to make a website with HTML," each with a brief summary and date (April 20, April 15, and April 12, 2024, respectively).](/assets/img/adding-a-blog-12.webp)

## A table of the (HTML) elements

Phew! We covered quite a few tags and added a lot of content during this chapter. It can be a lot to remember. If you ever need to look up how to use a particular HTML tag—or if you want to see what HTML tags are available to you—check out this handy [HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) on MDN. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) is more or less the official user manual of the web. Just search for any tag, attribute, or concept you want to know more about.

## Update the live site (optional)

If you want to upload your changes to Neocities, follow the same process as in previous chapters. Drag and drop the `blog` folder onto the drop zone to upload the entire folder simultaneously. Since you have updated the nav menu across all pages, you’ll also want to re-upload the Home and About pages.

Of course, you can also keep working _locally_ instead of uploading your progress now. It's up to you!

## Up next

Phew, we’ve finished our whirlwind tour of adding a blog with various tags! Next, we'll slow our pace and focus on page structure by adding a resume page you can share with potential employers.
