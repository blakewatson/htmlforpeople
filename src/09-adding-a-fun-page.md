# Adding a fun page

Alright, it’s time for some _fun_! Well, hopefully, all of it has been fun. But I still want to show you a handful of things you can do with HTML. I've saved this page for last because we'll use some of the more complex HTML tags.

## Create the file

Let’s create `fun.html` at the top level of the site folder. Use content from the homepage as a starting point, then change the `<title>` and `<h1>` to _Fun_ or similar. Clear out the contents of the `<main>` tag.

Now, we'll divide this page into multiple sections similar to the resume.

## Jokes

First up, let’s add a section for some jokes.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Jokes</h2>

  ...Jokes will go here
</section>
```

The idea is to show the setup of the joke but hide the punchline behind a click. You can [demo the live version here](https://demo.htmlforpeople.com/fun). We'll use the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements to achieve this behavior. They work like this.

```html
<details>
  <summary>This content will show up by default</summary>

  <p>
    Clicking the above content will cause this hidden content to become visible.
  </p>
</details>
```

Here’s a video demo of this element in action.

I’m going to add three admittedly corny jokes.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Jokes</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Why wouldn’t the skeleton cross the road?</summary>
    <p>It didn't have the guts.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why was the math book sad?</summary>
    <p>It had too many problems.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why don't scientists trust atoms?</summary>
    <p>Because they make up everything!</p>
  </details>
</section>
```

This is a silly example, but the `<details>`/`<summary>` elements are helpful whenever you want to make it easier for people to skim content and dig deeper where they choose. For example, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list.

## Using tables for tabletop gaming

Next up, let’s make use of the HTML table. The `<table>` tag and its related tags give us powerful ways to display information. For learning purposes, we'll create a small one. But if you need to display a lot of _tabular_ data, check out [MDN's page on tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table).

In tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons, the gamemaster often needs to improvise to create encounters for the adventuring players. One such way is by using a random table. It’s a table that will match dice rolls up with specific items, creatures, or events. We'll make a table with eight possible encounters the adventuring party might come across. The gamemaster will roll an eight-sided die and use the resulting encounter accordingly.

This is what the final table will look like.

<img src="/assets/img/adding-a-fun-page-1.webp" alt="A table titled 'Roll (1d8) Encounter' with two columns. The left column lists numbers 1 to 8, and the right column lists corresponding encounters: 1. Band of Goblins, 2. Wandering Merchant, 3. Group of Bandits, 4. Pack of Wolves, 5. Travelling Minstrels, 6. Lost Child, 7. Hidden Trap, 8. Old Hermit." style="max-height: 450px">

First, I will make a new `<section>` with a heading and some introductory text about D&D. Then, I will briefly introduce the random encounter table.

```html
<section>
  <h2>D&D stuff</h2>

  <p>
    Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a fun tabletop game where you create characters and go on epic adventures with friends. Guided by a Dungeon Master (DM), you'll roll dice to see what happens next. It's all about creativity, teamwork, and having a blast as you tackle quests, fight monsters, and find awesome treasures.
  </p>

  <h3>Random encounter table</h3>

  <p>
    This is a table you can use to randomly decide what enemy or creature the players are going to encounter. Just roll a d8.
  </p>

  ...The table will go here
</section>
```

We use the `<table>` tag to create a table. A table can have a head section and a body section.

```html
<table>
  <thead></thead>
  <tbody></tbody>
</table>
```

The table needs two columns—one for the dice roll and one for the corresponding encounter. Let's create a _table row_ inside the `<thead>`. I will fill out the head section and then explain it.

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Roll (1d8)</th>
      <th>Encounter</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody></tbody>
</table>
```

The `<tr>` tag creates a _table row_. Inside that row, we'll add two table cells. Because these are column headings, we will use the _table header_ or `<th>` tag—one for the dice roll and one for the outcome. This is what it will look like so far.

![An image describing Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) as a fun tabletop game involving character creation and adventures. There is a "Random encounter table" section with the headers of a table stubbed out.](/assets/img/adding-a-fun-page-2.webp)

Next, we can fill out our table using the _table data cell_ or `<td>` tag. We will put these rows inside the body section.

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Roll (1d8)</th>
      <th>Encounter</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Band of Goblins</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Wandering Merchant</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Group of Bandits</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>Pack of Wolves</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Travelling Minstrels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>Lost Child</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>Hidden Trap</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>Old Hermit</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

That's a lot of tags! Hopefully, you can follow the logic here. Inside the `<tbody>`, we create eight _table rows_, each with two _table data cells_. And that will give us our final table.

<img src="/assets/img/adding-a-fun-page-1.webp" alt="A table titled 'Roll (1d8) Encounter' with two columns. The left column lists numbers 1 to 8, and the right column lists corresponding encounters: 1. Band of Goblins, 2. Wandering Merchant, 3. Group of Bandits, 4. Pack of Wolves, 5. Travelling Minstrels, 6. Lost Child, 7. Hidden Trap, 8. Old Hermit." style="max-height: 450px">

HTML tables can also do some things you would do in a spreadsheet program, such as making a cell span multiple columns. We won't get into that here, but remember that tables have power if you need it.

## Embedded video

Last but not least, let's spice up our _Fun!_ page by adding some videos. I'll opt for some synthwave vibes. Of course, you are encouraged to grab whatever YouTube videos you like. Some YouTubers select to disallow their videos from being embedded on other sites, so keep that in mind.

I will make a new section for my videos.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Synthwave mixes</h2>

  ...videos will go here
</section>
```

First, I will grab this music mix called Waves (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6toYA0W4IA). If you visit that page, you will see a share button underneath the video. Clicking that button will give you various choices for sharing the video.

![Screenshot of a YouTube share dialog box for a post creation, showing sharing options for Embed, WhatsApp, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Email, and KakaoTalk. There's also a unique hyperlink with a "Copy" button next to it, and a checkbox to start at a specific time.](/assets/img/adding-a-fun-page-4.webp)

Select "Embed" if it is available. Once you do that, you will see some HTML code and a _Copy_ button. Go ahead and copy the code. You can paste the code after the `<h2>` tag.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Synthwave mixes</h2>

  <iframe
    width="560"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6toYA0W4IA?si=-Iu68cVS5E08st5O"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</section>
```

This embed is using the `<iframe>` tag. I won't go into great detail about this element, but in short, it is used to display a web page inside another web page. But when I reload the page, I am greeted with this "Video unavailable" error. Why?

![Screenshot of a webpage titled "Synthwave mixes" with an embedded video player in the center displaying a message that reads "Video unavailable. Watch on YouTube." There is an address bar at the top indicating a local file path.](/assets/img/adding-a-fun-page-5.webp)

It's because I still have my website open as a file. We need to fetch data from another website (YouTube), but browser security features prevent us from doing so.

### Running our local web server

No worries, though! This is why we installed a local web server in the previous chapter. If you haven't already done so, start your web server by following whichever method you chose in the previous chapter.

{% aside 'Note' %}
Unfortunately, things get a little weird here. Some of these server options, such as Live Preview and Simple Web Server, default to opening the browser at the IP address of `127.0.0.1`, which is essentially equivalent to `localhost`, the value other local servers use.

For reasons I don't fully understand, the embedded videos will not work when accessing the site using the IP address. You need to use `localhost`. Fortunately, that is as easy as manually replacing `127.0.0.1` with `localhost` in the address bar. If you use Microsoft Live Preview, you must view the site in your web browser instead of in the preview window.
{% endaside %}

I will use [WorldWideWeb](https://iconfactory.com/worldwideweb/) for this example. Once I point it to my site folder and click the play button, my server will be running, and I can visit it at the address provided.

![Screenshot of the same window. The interface shows a website folder named "my-site" and a web server with the URL "http://blakes-mac-studio.local:8080". There are icons for folder actions and buttons labeled "Reveal in Finder" and "Open Browser". The URL and Open Browser button are highlighted.](/assets/img/intermission-installing-a-local-web-server-5.webp)

Double-check your browser's address bar to ensure you access the web server version instead of the direct file.

![A web page titled "Synthwave mixes" featuring an embedded YouTube video player. The video is titled "Waves - A Chillwave Mix Vol. 2" and has a cover image with a futuristic design, including a planet and a beam of light. There’s a HTTP web address now instead of a local file path.](/assets/img/adding-a-fun-page-6.webp)

Awesome! I will go grab two more videos to use.

- https://youtu.be/rDfS8B2-Mt4
- https://youtu.be/yb0DR_qRetA

I will do the same thing for these that I did for the first one. Pull up the video page, click _Share_, then _Embed_, and copy the code provided. Paste the code for each video below the first one.

So, I embedded my videos, but now I'm noticing something else. It would be nice if these videos spanned the width of my page. Also, let's see what our website might look like on a phone.

![With Safari in responsive design mode, and the window narrowed to be mobile width, the YouTube video embed juts off the side of the page causing a horizontal scroll bar to appear..](/assets/img/adding-a-fun-page-7.webp)

If I view the website using Safari's _responsive design mode_ and narrow the viewport, I see the embedded videos run right off the right side of the page. Not ideal.

There are multiple ways we could fix this. We’re going to use a third-party solution.

### Custom HTML tags

HTML provides a way for us to create our own custom tags. These are called web components. They typically use a mixture of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to define the look and behavior of the component. Making our own web components is out of the scope of this book, but that's okay. We don't need to create one ourselves; we can use web components that other people have made.

We're going to use [Lite YouTube Embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed#readme). Feel free to read about what it can do. For our purposes, we just want to install it and have it display a full-width video that scales down properly on phones.

Before we go into how to install this component, let's look at how we would use it. It provides a new custom tag, `<lite-youtube>`. You give it an _attribute_ of `videoid`, which is the ID of the YouTube video. You can find the video's ID from the URL. This is my URL:

<pre>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6toYA0W4IA
                                |_________|
                                 video id</pre>

```html
<lite-youtube videoid="b6toYA0W4IA"></lite-youtube>
```

Much cleaner than the `<iframe>`!

Okay, let's get this thing installed. We need two files—one JavaScript file and one CSS file. The component developer provides these files, and together, they include all of the code that makes the component look and work properly. I will give you a direct link to both of them. Save the CSS file in your website's `css` folder. Then, create a `js` folder for the JavaScript file.

- JS file: <https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lite-youtube-embed/0.3.2/lite-yt-embed.min.js>
- CSS file: <https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lite-youtube-embed/0.3.2/lite-yt-embed.min.css>

Visit each of those and use _File > Save Page As…_ (Ctrl+S on Windows, Command+S on macOS). Once you have the files saved, add them to the page's `<head>` section. This is what it should look like.

```html
<head>
  <title>Fun - Blake's Homepage</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/simple.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/lite-yt-embed.min.css">
  <script src="js/lite-yt-embed.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

First, we add the CSS file (the order doesn't matter). We bring it in the same way we brought in Simple.css, using the `<link>` tag. We will also bring in the JavaScript code. For that, we use the `<script>` tag. It takes a `src` attribute, which is the path to the file.

Once these two files are present, we can use the new component. Back to our example. Let's say we have this YouTube URL:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6toYA0W4IA>

We need to get the ID from this URL. In a YouTube URL, the ID is the portion that comes after the `v=`. In this case, it's `b6toYA0W4IA`. So we can embed the video using the following syntax.

```html
<lite-youtube videoid="b6toYA0W4IA"></lite-youtube>
```

I will go ahead and do the other two videos this way as well.

```html
<lite-youtube videoid="b6toYA0W4IA"></lite-youtube>

<lite-youtube videoid="rDfS8B2-Mt4"></lite-youtube>

<lite-youtube videoid="yb0DR_qRetA"></lite-youtube>
```

It's looking good!

![A webpage in responsive design mode showcasing three synthwave mix cover images. The videos' widths have been fixed, but they are all slammed together, touching vertically. The top image features a stylized solar eclipse with the title "WAVES II: A Chillwave Mix." The middle image presents a neon cityscape titled "Neon Rooftops." The bottom image includes abstract neon graphics.](/assets/img/adding-a-fun-page-8.webp)

I will add some _horizontal rules_ to create some separation between these videos.

```html
<lite-youtube videoid="b6toYA0W4IA"></lite-youtube>
<hr>
<lite-youtube videoid="rDfS8B2-Mt4"></lite-youtube>
<hr>
<lite-youtube videoid="yb0DR_qRetA"></lite-youtube>
```

And let's check out what they look like at mobile size.

![The same image as before except now there are thin gray lines with some space separating the three videos vertically.](/assets/img/adding-a-fun-page-9.webp)

Nice!
