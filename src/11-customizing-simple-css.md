# Customizing Simple.css

Simple.css gives us a foundation for a nice, clean website. But it also provides a means of customization without a ton of extra work on our part. It uses a feature of CSS called _custom properties_ (often called _variables_). These variables allow us to change colors and fonts in one place with minimal coding needed.

## Peeking inside Simple.css

Let's open the `simple.css` file we previously added to our site to see what variables we can access. Don’t be deterred by how much code is in the file. We're only concerned with a little bit of it. At the top of the file, you will see some code that looks like the following.

```css
/* Global variables. */
:root,
::backdrop {
  /* Set sans-serif & mono fonts */
  --sans-font: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Avenir Next', Avenir,
    'Nimbus Sans L', Roboto, 'Noto Sans', 'Segoe UI', Arial, Helvetica,
    'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
  --mono-font: Consolas, Menlo, Monaco, 'Andale Mono', 'Ubuntu Mono', monospace;
  --standard-border-radius: 5px;

  /* Default (light) theme */
  --bg: #fff;
  --accent-bg: #f5f7ff;
  --text: #212121;
  --text-light: #585858;
  --border: #898ea4;
  --accent: #0d47a1;
  --accent-hover: #1266e2;
  --accent-text: var(--bg);
  --code: #d81b60;
  --preformatted: #444;
  --marked: #ffdd33;
  --disabled: #efefef;
}
```

We're getting into some CSS syntax here, but it’s perhaps not as scary as it first appears. Let’s break it down.

In CSS, the browser ignores text between `/*` and `*/`. It’s a way to write notes to yourself—or others reading your source code—called _comments_. In this case, the comments help to separate the code into related groups.

The bit that says `:root` means that the following block of code—the part between the squiggly brackets, `{}`—applies to the whole page. Ignore `::backdrop` for now.

Inside the squiggly brackets, we find a list of _properties_. We've seen CSS properties in a previous chapter. For example, we used `columns: 2` on the resume page to arrange a bulleted list into two columns. In that case, `columns` is a _property_ and `2` is a _value_.

Any property that starts with `--` is a _custom property_, or _variable_. It’s a way to reuse a value in multiple places. For example, if we had a variable `--accent: blue`, we could simultaneously use the `--accent` color in multiple elements. And if we ever decided to make the accent another color, say `red`, we could update it in one place—by writing `--accent: red`—and every element using the `--accent` variable will be updated automatically.

Looking back at the Simple.css code above, we see that we have two groups of variables. There are properties related to the fonts used, followed by a list of color-related variables representing what Simple calls the "default (light) theme."

We'll look at fonts later. Let’s first look at the colors.

In this case, most of the color variables are represented as hex codes. All you need to know about hex codes is that they are one of several ways to specify a color in CSS. Go to almost any search engine and search for "color picker." You’ll be greeted with a widget you can use to pick out a color and retrieve its hex code along with other formats.

Okay, so how do we set our own colors? Do we change them here inside `simple.css`? You _could_ do that; it would work. But there’s a better way.

## Creating a custom stylesheet

CSS stands for _Cascading Style Sheets_. The _cascading_ bit is particularly useful. Putting it simply, it means the order of CSS rules matters—rules that come later override rules before them. For our purposes, it means we can create our own CSS file, and so long as it’s processed by the browser _after_ `simple.css`, the rules we write there will take precedence. So we're not _changing_ `simple.css`. We're _overriding_ it.

Create a file in your `assets/css` folder called `custom.css`.

Now, let’s hook it up to the site. You’ll need to do this for every page on your site, but let’s start with the homepage, the top-level `index.html` file. In the `<head>` section, we're already referencing `simple.css` with a `<link>` tag. Let’s do the same for our new `custom.css` file right underneath. Order matters here. We want our stylesheet to come after Simple's so we can override its variables.

```html
<head>
  <title>Blake's Homepage</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/simple.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/custom.css">
</head>
```

{% aside 'Note' %}
This will work on the homepage, but for other pages, remember to update the file path accordingly (it'll be the same as the `simple.css` file path).
{% endaside %}

Now, let’s add some overrides. In our `custom.css` file, we'll first set up a `:root` code block similar to the one in `simple.css`. Then let’s take one of the variables, say `--bg` (the _background_ color), and set it to `red`.

```css
:root {
  --bg: red;
}
```

{% aside 'Note' %}
There’s nothing magic about the variable name, `--bg`. The creator of Simple.css decided to call it that, so that’s what we'll need to use to override it.
{% endaside %}

If you reload the page, you should see an admittedly hideous red background. Let's pick a better color. You can search for a [color picking tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker) of your choice on the web, use one of the many [named CSS colors](https://perma.cc/JF5G-REYD), or, if you are using Visual Studio Code, use the built-in color picker by hovering over a color value.

![In a Visual Studio Code editor window, a CSS file named "custom.css" is open. The editor displays an inline color picker tool beside the code that sets the background color with the property `--bg: red;`. The color picker shows various shades of red along with their RGB color values for easy selection and adjustment.](/assets/img/customizing-simple-css-1.webp)

But before picking out colors, let's talk about dark mode.

## Dark mode

Simple automatically supports light and dark modes based on the visitor's system setting. You may have noticed this if you have turned on dark mode in your system settings. If we look at the `simple.css` file, we can see the dark mode version of all of the variables just below the other variables we looked at previously.

```css
/* Dark theme */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root,
  ::backdrop {
    color-scheme: dark;
    --bg: #212121;
    --accent-bg: #2b2b2b;
    --text: #dcdcdc;
    --text-light: #ababab;
    --accent: #ffb300;
    --accent-hover: #ffe099;
    --accent-text: var(--bg);
    --code: #f06292;
    --preformatted: #ccc;
    --disabled: #111;
  }
  /* Add a bit of transparency so light media isn't so glaring in dark mode */
  img,
  video {
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
}
```

This block uses a CSS feature called _media queries_. In this case, the `@media` rule specifies that the style rules inside the block should apply if the user has indicated a preference for dark mode.

The first rule sets the default color scheme to dark and then _redefines_ the color variables that apply to the root document (i.e., the whole page). The second rule makes images and video slightly transparent so as not to appear "so glaring in dark mode."

We don't know whether visitors to our website prefer light or dark mode, so we should set appropriate colors for both modes. If you want, you could copy over these two code blocks (i.e., the "Global variables" block and the "Dark theme" block) from `simple.css` into your `custom.css` file and then proceed to change the color values as desired. Or you could specify only the ones you want to change. Either way, ensure you have the right colors in the right section.

## An example customization

For the default light theme, I decided to stick with only named CSS colors as a fun exercise. You can think of named colors like a box of crayons—there are many, but they don't represent every possible color. But they are an easy way to refer to colors in a human-friendly way.

On the other hand, the dark mode colors needed a more nuanced touch. I used the built-in color picker in Visual Studio Code to select a few specific colors. They are represented in the `rbg` format here because that's what the editor did by default when I selected the colors.

This is the code I put in my `custom.css` file.

```css
:root {
  --bg: mintcream;
  --border: darkslategray;
  --accent-bg: honeydew;
  --text: darkslategray;
  --accent: mediumvioletred;
  --accent-hover: mediumvioletred;
  --marked: mediumspringgreen;
}

/* Dark theme */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root,
  ::backdrop {
    color-scheme: dark;
    --bg: rgb(17, 18, 18);
    --border: rgb(80, 90, 90);
    --accent-bg: rgb(35, 35, 36);
    --text: ghostwhite;
    --accent: lightskyblue;
    --accent-hover: lightblue;
    --marked: gold;
  }
}
```

Here is a side-by-side preview of the blog index page's appearance in light and dark modes.

![A split-screen image showcases two iterations of a blog page: on the left, the page features a light custom color theme with vibrant pinks and pale greens. On the right, it uses a dark custom color theme with blue as an accent color for links and buttons. Both versions present identical content of the blog listing page. The use of custom colors here marks a departure from the default light and dark themes previously used.](/assets/img/customizing-simple-css-2.webp)

## Choosing accessible colors

Some color combinations can make text hard to read because of limited contrast. You want to ensure there is plenty of contrast between your text color and your background color.

You can rely on your eyes to an extent, but everyone is different. Fortunately, there are standards around how much contrast text should have. You can use a handy [contrast checker like this one](https://perma.cc/KGB2-G7Y4). Give it two colors, and it will tell you if there is sufficient contrast between them.

## Changing the font

I glossed over this earlier, but you may have noticed a couple of variables related to fonts above the color variables defined in `simple.css`. One of them, `--sans-font`, is responsible for most of the text on the page (the other one, `--mono-font`, is used for things like showing code, as I am doing in this paragraph).

If you aren't familiar, _sans-serif_ fonts are those that don't have _serifs_, the little feet-like protrusions you find on other fonts like Times New Roman. Simple uses the `--sans-font` variable for most text on the page by default, but we can override it with whatever we want.

First, let’s talk about fonts on the web.

## Fonts on the web

Your site's visitors can only see fonts installed on their system. That means if you, the author of the webpage, specify in CSS some random font you downloaded from a website, _you_ will see that font on the webpage. But your visitors will see a _fallback_, unless they also happen to have that font installed.

That's why multiple fonts are typically specified in CSS. If the first font specified isn't available on the visitor's computer or device, the browser will try the next one, and so on.

```css
body {
  /* the first font needs quotes because the name includes spaces */
  font-family: "Some Rando Font", Georgia, serif;
}
```

The above style rule sets the font for the `<body>`. The browser will first try to use "Some Rando Font." If that isn't available on the visitor's device, it will attempt to use Georgia instead. If _that_ isn't available, we've told the browser to use whatever default `serif` font it has available.

Here's a good reference for finding [fonts commonly found on people's devices](https://practicaltypography.com/system-fonts.html) to see your options. You always want to provide a handful of decent fallbacks as well.

Sometimes, you have a font that you _really_ want visitors to see even though you know they aren't going to have it installed on their system already. Fortunately, there is a way to deal with this. They're called _web fonts_. They are too involved to cover here, but I will cover them briefly in the next chapter, [CSS basics](/css-basics). In short, it’s a method of automatically providing the font to your visitors.

## Overriding the font variable

Let's use a serif font. Even though Simple calls the variable `--sans-font`, there is nothing magical about the variable name. We can set it to whatever we want. Let's use Georgia, which is always a pleasure to read.

We can override Simple's `--sans-font` variable inside the `:root` block so that it applies to the whole page.

```css
:root {
  --sans-font: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;
  --bg: mintcream;
  --border: darkslategray;
  --accent-bg: honeydew;
  --text: darkslategray;
  --accent: mediumvioletred;
  --accent-hover: mediumvioletred;
  --marked: mediumspringgreen;
}
```

We specified the font, Georgia, but we also provided two fallback options. We specified Times New Roman as our second choice. Note that this one needs to be inside quotes because the name has spaces.

We use a CSS keyword, `serif`, for the third option. That tells the browser to use its default serif font, whatever that may be. Often, it will be Times New Roman. Other keywords you have available here are `sans-serif`, `monospace`, and `cursive`, [among others](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#syntax)

Here’s a look at one of the blog posts set in Georgia.

![Screenshot of a blog post titled "Why donuts are the best thing ever," dated April 20, 2024. It’s using the customized light theme from before. The text is set in a serif font rather than the default sans serif.](/assets/img/customizing-simple-css-3.webp)

## Make it yours

I chose Simple.css for this book because it makes HTML look good without any extra work. But I also chose it because it can be customized with a handful of CSS variables. Even though it’s just colors and fonts, there are endless possibilities for making your site unique.

I encourage you to explore the world of color and experiment with different combinations. In the next bonus chapter, I'll cover even more CSS so you can go beyond Simple and write your own styles.
